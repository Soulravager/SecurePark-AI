## üß† Overview

**SecurePark AI** is an integrated pre-development prototype that combines **parking management** with **AI-powered surveillance tools**. Utilizing image processing, real-time video feeds, and number plate recognition, the system can detect incoming and outgoing vehicles, assign parking spots dynamically, and manage access levels efficiently.

It provides a seamless experience for vehicle owners and powerful oversight tools for parking administrators. By combining **automation, security, and smart data logging**, the system helps reduce human intervention, enhance surveillance, and improve parking efficiency.
